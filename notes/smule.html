You start a company for the love of doing something.  No other reason 
should suffice.  
<br><br>
For me, this is why Smule was created – as an experiment to bring our 
interest and passion in computer music research to a lot of people.  Maybe 
millions.  And in doing so, we’d get to explore new physical interaction 
design, music software design, and musical expression.  The mission: to 
bring the joy of music-making to everyone through artful application of 
technology, and to find new mediums of musical/social interaction.
<br><br>

So in Spring 2008, a few months before Apple launched the very first App 
Store, I found Jeff Smith (seasoned entrepreneur of 20 years pursuing 
Music PhD at Stanford) and myself (in 2007 joined the faculty at 
Stanford’s CCRMA; no intention to concurrently start a company) 
contemplating what was to become Smule.  Memorably, this happened over 
hamburgers at the Dutch Goose, a dimly-lighted establishment near 
Stanford, and where peanut shells carpeted the floor.  Five years later, 
Smule has created more than a dozen musical apps for iOS and Android, and 
more than 100 million users.  
<br><br>

As I now officially leave Smule and my role as Chief Creative, I am filled 
with emotion for an incredibly unique adventure together.  Since 
inception, Smule has been a part of me, and a great deal of my research 
(physical/social interaction design for music, software and apps as 
interactive art) and teaching (since 2010 I have taught “Mobile Music” at 
Stanford University, inspired from my Smule experiences).  Of the many 
emotions, the one I feel the strongest is gratitude for a most unique 
opportunity and journey together.  I am indebted to my co-founder Jeff for 
sharing and fostering the vision – and giving his trust, guidance, and 
support to undertake such a crazy adventure together.  Similarly, our 
board and investors not only put forth their trust and capital, but also 
shared a genuine sense of curiosity and wonder at the possibilities (which 
I have always felt to be much harder to raise than even money).
<br><br>

As with most journeys, what you will miss most are your brothers- and 
sisters-in-arms – those who stand with you at every turn, good or ill.  
For me that’s the crazy, wonderful, creative people of Smule.  At the end 
of the day, one might take pride in things accomplished, or wish 
this-or-that turned out differently, but what you truly take away are the 
simple shared experiences.  The simple joy of building things together; 
late night hacking sessions at Denny’s, or over hotpot (Smule’s a very 
food-driven culture); creating a video to launch a new product.  Declaring 
a company holiday to play Starcraft 2 (that only happened on two 
occasions, but glorious they were).  And countless more moments that 
helped define Smule’s culture and who we are behind our products.  To all 
Smuleans, thank you.  I wish you music and happiness always!  Well-wishing 
also to our collaborators during my time at Smule, including Lang Lang, 
T-Pain, folks at Apple (S and C, you know who you are!  And frankly, 
without the iPhone and App Store, there probably would be no Smule.)
<br><br>

I have often thought of Smule as a “people-powered music company”.  
Without our users, and in great numbers as they are, we’d lose the magic.  
To each user who has ever tried to blow into their iPhone to play Ocarina, 
or banged out notes in Magic Piano, or sang/played with a stranger across 
the globe in Sing! or Guitar!, I am truly grateful.
<br><br>

As much as I have cherished my dual role as academic and “accidental 
entrepreneur” (as I’ve been called sometimes), I strive to be a good 
professor, to the best of my abilities.  I love research, to create art 
out of software and interaction, and I love teaching (despite my best 
efforts, I always end up learning much more from my students than the 
other way around).  I actually got to do all of this in my dual role, but 
at the same time, it has been pretty insane.  Smule, to the credit of its 
people, is an amazing company and I moving forward with sadness but also 
great hope for its future.  I am also filled with excitement for my 
continuing academic adventures ahead!  And although I will no longer be 
officially representing Smule, I will continue, as co-founder, to tell its 
story – our story – in the unfolding saga of music and computers, people 
and technology.
<br><br>

With this, I say: farewell Smule.  I will be with you in spirit and, to 
borrow a quote from ABBA, thank you for the music.  And the food.
<br><br>

With much love,
