Ge Wang is an Assistant Professor at Stanford University in the Center for 
Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA), and researches 
programming languages and interactive software design for computer music, 
mobile and social music, laptop orchestras, and education at the 
intersection of computer science and music.  Ge is the author of the 
ChucK audio programming language, the founding director of the Stanford 
Laptop Orchestra (SLOrk) and of the Stanford Mobile Phone Orchestra 
(MoPhO).  Ge is also the Co-founder of Smule (reaching over 100 million 
users), and the designer of the iPhone's <i>Ocarina</i> and <i>Magic 
Piano</i>.

Ge Wang is an Assistant Professor at Stanford University's Center for 
Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA).  He received his B.S. in 
Computer Science in 2000 from Duke University, and his Ph.D. in Computer 
Science in 2008 from Princeton University.  Ge's research includes 
programming languages and interactive software systems for computer music, 
mobile and social music, new performance ensembles (laptop orchestras and 
mobile phone orchestras) and paradigms (e.g., live coding), interfaces for 
human-computer interaction, musical visualization, and methodologies for 
education at the intersection of computer science and music.  Ge is the 
author and chief architect of the ChucK audio programming language.  He 
is the founding director of the Stanford Laptop Orchestra (SLOrk) and 
Stanford Mobile Phone Orchestra (MoPhO), and was a co-director of the 
Princeton Laptop Orchestra (PLOrk).  Ge composes and performs via various 
electro-acoustic and computer-mediated means.  Ge is the 
Co-founder (and former Chief Creative) of the mobile music startup Smule 
(reaching over 100 million users), and the designer of <i>Ocarina</i> and 
<i>Magic Piano</i> for the iPhone.

director of the Stanford Laptop Orchestra (SLOrk) and Stanford Mobile 
Phone Orchestra (MoPhO), and was a co-director of the Princeton Laptop 
Orchestra (PLOrk).  Ge composes and performs via various electro-acoustic 
and computer-mediated means, including with PLOrk/SLOrk, with Perry as a 
live coding duo, and with Rebecca Fiebrink in a duo exploring new 
performance paradigms, cool audio software, and great food.  
Ge is the Co-founder and former Chief Creative of the mobile music 
startup Smule (reaching over 100 million users), and the designer of 
<i>Ocarina</i>, <i>Leaf Trombone: World Stage</i>, and <i>Magic Piano</i> for the 
iPhone.

<br>
Ge joins the Stanford music faculty as an assistant 
professor in the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics 
(CCRMA).  He excitedly looks forward to many things, including working 
with the faculty, researchers, and students and forging new directions 
in computer music research, software, and pedagogy, as well as writing 
music and initiating and developing new performance ensembles and 
paradigms, including a Stanford Laptop Orchestra.
