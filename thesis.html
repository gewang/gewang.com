<b>Abstract</b>

<p align="justify">

The computer has long been considered an extremely attractive tool for 
creating, manipulating, and analyzing sound.  Its precision, possibilities 
for new timbres, and potential for fantastical automation make it a 
compelling platform for expression and experimentation - but only to the 
extent that we are able to express to the computer what to do, and how to 
do it.  To this end, the programming language has perhaps served as the 
most general, and yet most precise and intimate interface between humans 
and computers.   Furthermore, "domain-specific" languages can bring 
additional expressiveness, conciseness, and perhaps even different ways of 
thinking to their users.

<br><br>

This thesis argues for the philosophy, design, and development of ChucK 
(get via <a target="_blank" 
href="http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/">@princeton</a> | 
<a target="_blank" href="http://chuck.stanford.edu/">@stanford</a>), 
a general-purpose programming language tailored for computer music.  The 
goal is to create a language that is <i>expressive</i> and <i>easy to 
write and read</i> with respect to time and parallelism, and to provide a 
platform for precise audio synthesis/analysis and rapid experimentation in 
computer music.  In particular, ChucK provides a syntax for representing 
information flow, a new time-based concurrent programming model that 
allows programmers to flexibly and precisely control the flow of time in 
code (we call this "strongly-timed"), and facilities to develop programs 
<i>on-the-fly</i> - as they run.  A ChucKian approach to <i>live 
coding</i> as a new musical performance paradigm is also described.  In 
turn, this motivates the Audicle, a specialized graphical environment 
designed to facilitate on-the-fly programming, to visualize and monitor 
ChucK programs in real-time, and to provide a platform for building highly 
customizable user interfaces.

<br><br>

In addition to presenting the ChucK programming language, a history of 
music and programming is provided (Chapter 2), and the various aspects of 
the ChucK language are evaluated in the context of computer music 
research, performance, and pedagogy (Chapter 6).  As part of an extensive 
case study, the thesis discusses ChucK as a primary teaching and 
development tool in the Princeton Laptop Orchestra (PLOrk), which 
continues to be a powerful platform for deploying ChucK 1) to teach topics 
ranging from programming to sound synthesis to music composition, and 2) 
for crafting new instruments, compositions, and performances for 
computer-mediated ensembles.  Additional applications are also described, 
including classrooms, live coding arenas, compositions and performances, 
user studies, and integrations of ChucK into other software systems.

<br><br>

The contributions of this work include the following. 1) A time-based 
programming mechanism (both language and underlying implementation) for 
ultra-precise audio synthesis, naturally extensible to real-time audio 
analysis.  2) A non-preemptive, time/event-based concurrent programming 
model that provides fundamental flexibility and readability without 
incurring many of the difficulties of programming concurrency.  3) A 
ChucKian approach to writing code and designing audio programs on-the-fly.  
This rapid prototyping mentality has potentially wide ramifications in the 
way we think about coding audio, in designing/testing software (particular 
for real-time audio), as well as new paradigms and practices in 
computer-mediated live performance.  4) The Audicle as a new type of audio 
programming environment that combines live development with 
visualizations.  5) Extended case studies of using, teaching, composing, 
and performing with ChucK, most prominently in the Laptop Orchestra. These 
show the power of teaching programming via music, and vice versa - and how 
these two disciplines can reinforce each other.
